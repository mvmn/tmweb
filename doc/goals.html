			<h2>Project goals</h2>
			<p>
				Main goal of the project is to create PHP/MySQL website engine
				for Toastmasters Clubs websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides providing public information about the club to the outside world,
				toastmasters clubs websites based on this engine should be able
				to facilitate fighting several particular problems of TM Clubs,
				namely: a) lack of competitive attitude among members (which eventually
				causes apathy, slow progress, absentheism etc) and b) absence or low clarity 
				of club members progress information.
			</p> 
			<p>
				In order to inspire club members to work harder on their progress, club website
				should present members progress information in condensed and convenient form, 
				displaying each members progress side by side in such form, that would allow club
				members to easily see, who's progress fast, and who is going slow, and thus trigger
				a competitive spark among them. To accomplish this goal, website engine will provide
				as a part of public information two tables: members speeches progress table and members
				roles participation table.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both of these tables will allow club offices to easily track status and progress 
				of members of the club, and thus identify members that for example need help, 
				or on contrary, can help other members. For instance, if some member has been taking
				timer role for many times, while other member has never been a timer before, VP of
				education can easily see this in a table, and advice the weaker member to ask
				that more experienced member for guidance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One more extra feature planned for this project is a meetings timeline table.
				Contrary to previous two, this table won't be publicly available to any site visitor,
				but only to club officers. In this table club officer should be able to see club
				meetings timeline for a certain period (with pagination for accessing earlier/later 
				periods data), in which he is supposed to easily see times when meetings were cancelled,
				and kind+amount of activities peformed at each meetings (i.e. speeches projects, advanced
				speeches projects, table topics, debates, games etc), grouped by performing member, 
				or by kind of activity. This table will allow club officers to keep track of 
				activities and members recent engagement, thus allowing them to notice trends
				and problems like for example having a debate section each meeting for last 5 meetings,
				or not having certain activity on meetings for long time. As well as member trens, like
				seeting if some of club members recently stopped taking any other roles than 
				timer for example.
			</p>
			<p>
				Administration interface will be provided to club officers in order to populate base 
				information (members, kinds of roles, kinds of speech programs etc).
			</p>
			<p>
				Special functionality of the site will be dedicated to forming future meeting agenda by
				allowing club members to log-in and sign-up for a role, and allowing club officers
				to assing/re-assign members, create new meeting (thus storing past meeting information 
				in archive with populating the stats tables) etc.
			</p>
			<h3>Speeches progress table example</h3>
			<p>
				The table content is quite straightforward: list of members ordered by number of speeches
				accomplished by a member, and a column that displays each speech as a colored square.
				Color represents one of the speech programs, and is faded for older speeches using 
				configurable fade rate. In this example, green represents mandatory base speech program - 
				the Competent Communicator program. And blue represent one of the advanced programs
				(like Public Relations, Storytelling etc). Count of table cells in accomplishment in a row
				is equal to number of speech projects performed by the member who accomplished most of them
				among club members (his row is therefore completely filled with colors).
				For all members who accomplished less speech projects there will be empty cells in
				accomplishment row.

			<h3>Roles participation table example</h3>
			<p>
				This table contains pictographic display of club members roles taking. 
				Due to possibility of taking some role very many times by one user over time, grouping
				for 10-times taking might be needed (using some noticeable pictogram).
				The goal is to make roles taking activity very vivid by displaying each activity as one
				pictogram, and each 10-times by big more noticeable pictogram, thus making it very
				visually clear which members have been active on taking roles, and which still have to
				catch up.
